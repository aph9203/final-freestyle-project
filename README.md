This is the first step of the project.
It fetches one daily meal plan from the Spoonacular API using only calories as input.
The API key is stored in a `.env` file for security.

1. Create a `.env` file with:
SPOONACULAR_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run:
python -m app.meal_planner
